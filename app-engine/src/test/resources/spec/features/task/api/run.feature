Feature: [URS00003-TASK] Execute a task

  Background:
    Given App Engine is up and running
    And File storage service is up and running
    And Registry service is up and running

  @Scheduler
  Scenario Outline: successful run request for a provisioned task run
    Given a task run "<task_run_id>" has successfully been created for a task
    And this task run has been successfully provisioned and is therefore in state 'PROVISIONED'
    When When user calls the endpoint to run task with HTTP method POST
    Then App Engine sends a "200" OK response with a payload containing the success message (see OpenAPI spec)
    And App Engine moves the task run to a state different from "<excluded_transition_states>"
    And App Engine initiates the process of executing the task run

    Examples:
      | task_run_id                          | excluded_transition_states |

  @Scheduler
  Scenario Outline: unsuccessful run request of a task which has not been provisioned
    Given a task run "<task_run_id>" has successfully been created for a task
    And this task run has not been successfully provisioned yet and is therefore in state "<initial_state>"
    When When user calls the endpoint to run task with HTTP method POST
    Then App Engine sends a "403" Forbidden response with a payload containing the error message (see OpenAPI spec) and code "<error_code>"
    And this task run remains in state "<initial_state>"
    And App Engine does not initiate the process of executing this task run

    Examples:
      | task_run_id                          | initial_state | error_code                                  |

  @Scheduler
  Scenario Outline: unsuccessful run request for a task that was already launched
    Given a task run "<task_run_id>" has successfully been created for a task
    And App Engine has already received a run request for this task run which is therefore not in state "<excluded_states>"
    When When user calls the endpoint to run task with HTTP method POST
    Then App Engine sends a "403" Forbidden response with a payload containing the error message (see OpenAPI spec) and code "<error_code>"
    And this task run state progress is not affected by the request
    And App Engine does not re-initiate the process of executing this task run

    Examples:
      | task_run_id                          | excluded_states     | error_code                         |

    Then App Engine sends a "200" OK response with a payload containing task run information (see OpenAPI spec)
    And the retrieved task run information matches the expected details
    And the task run state remains as "<task_run_state>"

    Examples:
